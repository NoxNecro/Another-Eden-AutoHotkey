# Another Eden Macros
Auto Hotkey scripts for the JRPG "Another Eden: The Cat Beyond Time and Space"

## Introduction

If you're like me and prefer playing Another Eden on Steam rather than an emulator or mobile device, you might have noticed the lack of functional macros available for the Steam version. 
That's where this project comes in. Here I will be adding macros I make using Auto Hotkey. They will be available as the original .ahk file and in .exe format. If you're unsure of which version to choose, check out my summary [here](.ahk-or-.exe)

## Installation
1. Download the latest version of your wanted macro [here](github.com/NoxNecro/Another-Eden-AutoHotkey/releases/latest).
2. Choose whether you want to use

## .ahk or .exe

### .AHK File:

**Positives:**
- **Customization:** Users can easily customize the script according to their needs by modifying the code directly.
- **Transparency:** The script's logic and functionality are visible in the code, allowing users to understand and verify its behavior.
- **Learning:** Users interested in scripting can learn from the code and improve their AutoHotkey skills.
- **Debugging:** Issues and errors in the script are easier to diagnose and fix due to the availability of source code.

**Negatives:**
- **Dependency:** Users need to have AutoHotkey installed on their system to run the script.
- **Security:** Source code exposure might lead to potential security risks or misuse of the script's functionality.
- **Complexity:** Users with limited coding experience might find it challenging to modify or troubleshoot the script.

### .EXE File:

**Positives:**
- **Portability:** Users can run the executable without needing to install AutoHotkey separately.
- **Ease of Use:** No coding or scripting knowledge is required to use the executable.
- **Security:** The source code remains hidden, reducing the risk of unauthorized modifications.
- **Distribution:** It's easier to distribute and share a single executable file.

**Negatives:**
- **Limited Customization:** Users cannot easily modify the behavior of the executable unless provided with specific options by the developer.
- **Transparency:** Users cannot directly inspect the logic of the executable, which might raise concerns about its functionality.
- **Debugging:** Debugging issues within the executable can be more challenging due to the lack of access to source code.

## Which to Choose:
- **AHK File:** If you want to learn from, modify, and/or contribute to the script, using the AHK file is a good choice.
- **EXE File:** If your aim is to get a hassle-free experience and simply want to use the macro without any coding involvement, using the compiled executable is an option.

###My personal Opinion
I personally prefer using the .AHK file, as that is the one I extensively test while coding. If you need help or have an issue this is also the file I will ask you to try in case the problem lies with the .exe file instead of the program itself. In the end you'll have to choose between convinience and usability.
