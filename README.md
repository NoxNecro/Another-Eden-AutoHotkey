# Another Eden Macros
Auto Hotkey scripts for the JRPG "Another Eden: The Cat Beyond Time and Space"

## Introduction

If you're like me and prefer playing Another Eden on Steam rather than an emulator or phone, you might have noticed the lack of functional macros available for the Steam version. 
That's where this project comes in. Here I will be adding macros I make using Auto Hotkey. They will be available as both the original .ahk file and in .exe format.

**!The general rule of my macros is that to stop them, you have to press F12!** 
Forgetting this can be quite annoying, especially with macros that move your mouse around and loop infinitely until stopped...

If you need to contact me for any reason, feel free to do so on discord. My username is NoxNecro. 


## Installation
1. Download the latest version of your wanted macro [here](https://github.com/NoxNecro/Another-Eden-AutoHotkey/releases/latest)
2. Choose whether you want to use the the .ahk version or the .exe version (unsure? Check out [this summary](https://github.com/NoxNecro/Another-Eden-AutoHotkey/blob/main/README.md#ahk-or-exe))
3. Open another eden and go to the place where you want to start the macro
4. Click on the .ahk/.exe file

 yes, that's really how easy it is!


## .ahk or .exe

### .ahk File:

An AHK file is an uncompiled executable that does not contain a program's code and/or resources, thus needing both Auto Hotkey and potential dependencies to be installed.

**Positives:**
- **Customization:** If you know Auto Hotkey and/or have programming experience, Then the script is easily customizable according to your needs by modifying the code directly.
- **Transparency:** The script's logic and functionality are visible in the code, allowing you to understand and verify its behavior.
- **Learning:** If you are interested in scripting, then learning from the code and improving your AutoHotkey skills is also an option.
- **Debugging:** Issues and errors in the script are easier to diagnose and fix due to the availability of source code.

**Negatives:**
- **Dependency:** AutoHotkey and possible dependecies are required on your system to run the script.
- **Complexity:** If you have limited coding experience you might find it challenging to modify or troubleshoot the script.

### .exe File:

An EXE file is a compiled executable that contains a program's code and resources, allowing users to run the program without needing the original source code.

**Positives:**
- **Portability:**  The executable can be ran without needing to install AutoHotkey separately.
- **Ease of Use:** No coding or scripting knowledge is required to use the macro.

**Negatives:**
- **Limited Customization:** The behavior of the executable can't easily be customized.
- **Transparency:** The logic of the executable cannot be directly inspected, meaning that there is a potential of it containing malicious code. (it doesn't, but it technically could without you knowing.) .
- **Debugging:** Debugging issues within the executable can be more challenging due to the lack of access to source code.

### Which to Choose:
- **AHK File:** If you want to learn from, modify, and/or contribute to the script, using the AHK file or want debugging to be easier then this is the right choice.
- **EXE File:** If your aim is to get a hassle-free experience and simply want to use the macro without anything else, using the compiled executable is an option.

###My personal Opinion
I personally prefer using the .ahk file, as that is the one I extensively test while coding. If you need help or have an issue this is also the file I will ask you to try in case the problem lies with the .exe file instead of the program itself. Aditionally, if the problem lies in the convertion between the .ahk and .exe file I won't be able to solve it nor help you, as this is automatically done by Auto Hotkey. This means that in the end you'll have to choose between convenience and practicality.
