# Another-Eden-AutoHotkey
 Auto Hotkey scripts for the JRPG "Another Eden: The Cat Beyond Time and Space"

Apparently I'm one of the few people who play Another Eden on steam instead of on an emulator or on mobile. This consequently means that there are _very_ few working macros for the steam version of Another Eden. I'm here to set that right.
